Design Requirements
1. A high-level architectural view of your application in which
auto-scalability features have been shown.
2. A state diagram that shows the state, events and actions in the
auto-scaler.
3. The pseudocode of the auto-scaling algorithm along with reasons
behind the parameter settings in the algorithm; important parameters
may include lower and higher thresholds, the length of the monitoring
interval, scaling policies, etc.
All design artifacts should be stored in a folder named “Design” in your
project repository.
